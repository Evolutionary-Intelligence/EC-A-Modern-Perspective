Although we have given **many** problem instances where EAs showed **satisfactory** (*not necessarily optimal*) performance, *NOT all problems* could be best solved by EAs: e.g., [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590238522006622), just to name a few. We believe that the amount of problem instances tackled effectively by EA will still keep increasing in the future.
