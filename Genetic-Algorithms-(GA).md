  * "[Graph-GA](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/sc/c8sc05372c) dominates the leaderboard in terms of optimization ability, while a simple SMILES LSTM ranked behind. The SOAT ML models that reported excellent performances in unlimited trivial oracles cannot beat virtual screening when allowing less than 5,000 oracle calls. This result questions the utility of the current ML SOTA methods and calls for a shift of focus on the current ML molecular generation communities to consider realistic constraints during evaluation."

## Theoretical Advances of GA

### Schema Theorem and Building Block Hypothesis (BBH)

"[From the perspective of function optimization, the schema theorem does not provide any guarantee of convergence to, or divergence from, any optimum solution. This is a significant weakness of the theorem.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0303264796016577)" (from [Beyer, 1997, BioSystems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0303264796016577))
