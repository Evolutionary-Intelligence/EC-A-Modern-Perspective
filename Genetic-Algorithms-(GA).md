  * "[Graph-GA](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/sc/c8sc05372c) dominates the leaderboard in terms of optimization ability, while a simple SMILES LSTM ranked behind. The SOAT ML models that reported excellent performances in unlimited trivial oracles cannot beat virtual screening when allowing less than 5,000 oracle calls. This result questions the utility of the current ML SOTA methods and calls for a shift of focus on the current ML molecular generation communities to consider realistic constraints during evaluation."
