# Learning and Evolution

## The Baldwin Effect

As pointed out by [Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) ([ACM Turing Award Laureate](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hinton_4791679.cfm)) and Nowlan, ["The main limitation of the Baldwin effect is that it is only effective in spaces that would be hard to search without an adaptive process to restrcuture the space"](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/baldwin.pdf).
