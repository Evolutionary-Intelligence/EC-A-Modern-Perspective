## Multi-Scale/Level Evolution and Learning

["The processes of life involve change at many scales of space and time. Choosing a spatiotemporal scale emphasizes the change at that scale, rendering smaller scales essentially as noise, large scales essentially as constant. One trade-off between learning (at the individual level) and evolution (at the level of population or species) is readily apparent: Learning is facilitated by long individual lifetimes, whereas evolution benefits from rapidly passing generations."](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-INSTITUTE-SCIENCES-COMPLEXITY-PROCEEDINGS/dp/0201525712) [Ackley&Littman, 1991].

## Baldwin Effect

As pointed out by [Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) ([ACM Turing Award Laureate](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hinton_4791679.cfm)) and Nowlan, ["The main limitation of the Baldwin effect is that it is only effective in spaces that would be hard to search without an adaptive process to restrcuture the space"](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/baldwin.pdf).
