For an early review regarding to this topic, please refer to Nolfi and Floreano's 1999 paper on
[Autonomous Robots]().

## Benefits and Costs

In Nolfi and Floreano's 1999 paper,

## Multi-Scale/Level Evolution and Learning

["The processes of life involve change at many scales of space and time. Choosing a spatiotemporal scale emphasizes the change at that scale, rendering smaller scales essentially as noise, large scales essentially as constant. One trade-off between learning (at the individual level) and evolution (at the level of population or species) is readily apparent: Learning is facilitated by long individual lifetimes, whereas evolution benefits from rapidly passing generations."](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-INSTITUTE-SCIENCES-COMPLEXITY-PROCEEDINGS/dp/0201525712) [Ackley&Littman, 1991].

## Baldwin Effect

As pointed out by [Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) ([ACM Turing Award Laureate](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hinton_4791679.cfm)) and Nowlan, ["The main limitation of the Baldwin effect is that it is only effective in spaces that would be hard to search without an adaptive process to restrcuture the space"](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/baldwin.pdf).

"[acquired characters](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/276428)"

In [Whitley]() et al.'s paper on [PPSN-1994](), initial simulation experiments demonstrated that GA with
the Baldwin effect sometimes finds the global optimum while Lamarckian GA sometimes gets trapped into
the local optima, though the latter shows faster convergence at the early evolution stage. However, more
simulation and real-life experiments are still expected nowadays to compare them.
