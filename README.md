# Evolutionary Computation: A Modern Perspective

This is a *free/online* book: **Evolutionary Computation: A Modern Perspective**, written/edited by *Qiqi Duan* and *Yijun Yang* @ **SUSTech, Shenzhen, China**. We start to write this open book from July, 2023 and plan to finish it in December, 2025. Owing to its *open* nature, any suggestions, improvements, and corrections to it are **highly encouraged**.
