# Evolutionary Computation: A Modern Perspective

This is a *free/online* book: **Evolutionary Computation: A Modern Perspective**, written/edited by *Qiqi Duan* and *Yijun Yang* @ **SUSTech, Shenzhen, China**. We start to write this open book from July, 2023 and plan to finish it in December, 2025. Owing to its *open* nature, any suggestions, improvements, corrections to it are highly encouraged.

## Preface

An important yet difficult question to answer is the (underlying) **assumptions** behind EAs (followed closely by their **working principles**). Although initially their **biological evolution-based inspiration** is an attractive point to readers, researchers, and practitioners (at the beginning stage), undoubtedly its **mathematical foundations and practical usefulness** play a cornerstone role in the (increasing) maturity of this field (i.e., Evolutionary Computation).

Our **modest** goal for this book is to provide basic information regarding to EC, in order to help the novices foster the ability of judging **whether it is a good research practice or not for EC**, which we think is very important especially for some novices.

Up to now, there have been several wonderful books devoted to EC, such as [[Eiben&Smith, 2015]](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-44874-8), [[Fogel, 2006]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/5237910)/[[Fogel, 1998]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/5263042), [[Back, 1996]](https://academic.oup.com/book/40791).
