# Preface

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=Evolutionary-Intelligence.ECAMP-Preface)

As shown by [Frances H. Arnold](http://fhalab.caltech.edu/), Prof. of California Institute of
Technology, in her Nobel Lecture, "[Responsible for adaptation, optimization, and innovation in
the living world, evolution executes a simple algorithm of diversification and natural selection,
an algorithm that works at all levels of complexity from single protein molecules to whole
ecosystems.](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/arnold-lecture.pdf)" Some of fundamental
principles (e.g., natural selection) of biological evolution originated from e.g., [Alfred Russel
Wallace](https://tinyurl.com/yvwmuv9b) and [Charles Robert Darwin](https://tinyurl.com/5ywts76r).
These fundamental principles, however, *can be* and *have been* employed on **complex**
computational (e.g., [evolutionary algorithms](https://tinyurl.com/y57b2r96)), design (e.g.,
[artificial life](https://direct.mit.edu/artl)), and engineering (e.g., [directed
evolution](http://fhalab.caltech.edu/)) problems (*often* though *not always* with promising or
satisfactory performance). In this entirely open book, we focus on **computational (rather
biological) evolution** for modeling, optimization, learning, and design, from both the
*historical* and *modern* perspective.

Although initially (especially at the beginning stage) their so-called biological-evolution-based
inspirations (in the form of [metaphors](https://tinyurl.com/mtmwez9h)) are an attractive /
interesting point to readers, researchers, and practitioners, undoubtedly their **mathematical
foundations (theoretical insights), algorithmic frameworks (implementation softwares), and
practical usefulness (real-world successes)**, which are of our great interest in this open book,
play three cornerstone roles in the increasing maturity of the [Evolutionary Computing
(EC)](https://tinyurl.com/48r89bv2) field, including but not limited to Evolutionary Algorithms
(EAs).

Our modest goal for this open book is to provide basic information regarding to EC and some
(*not all*) advanced EC topics, in order to help *perplexed* novices foster the desirable ability
of judging whether or not it is a [good](https://tinyurl.com/msxvdkfb) research practice on EC,
which we think is very crucial for *perplexed* novices in the [explosion of metaphor-centred
methods](https://publications.aston.ac.uk/id/eprint/44574/1/ALIFE_LLCS.pdf) and the rise of
[Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://chat.openai.com/). Our main focus on EC is and should be
**general principles** of designing and analyzing EAs (that is, *whether, when, why, and how to
use EC*) and their **real-world applications**, rather than only their biological metaphors
(though some metaphors played an interesting/important role in their early formation stage).
Although we believe there may be more or less [opportunities](https://tinyurl.com/mpdhne4f)
to extend it (such as [Quality-Diversity](https://tinyurl.com/3c5bzumz)) significantly, most of
its **fundamentally** algorithmic structures have been fixed/unchanged over the past 20 years,
to some extents. For effectiveness and efficiency, ["leveraging (or learning) the statistical
and computational structure of problem"](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/MAL-070)
no matter *explicitly* or *implicitly* is now one of main research goals when desiging different
EA versions, variants, extensions, and improvements for different kinds of **hard** problems
(such as [FunSearch](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6),
[Persistent ES](https://icml.cc/virtual/2021/poster/10175),
[OpenAI-ES](https://openai.com/index/evolution-strategies/),
[EDA](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume24/22-0628/22-0628.pdf),
[Surrogate Models](),
[CMA-ES](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-467/14-467.pdf),
[NES](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/wierstra14a/wierstra14a.pdf),
[Population-Based Training (PBT)](https://tinyurl.com/428mrb4f),
just to name a few).

First, an important-yet-difficult research question to be answered is the underlying assumptions
behind [Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14544). Since the
**black-box** (or more generally, **complex**) nature of hard (e.g., NP-hard) problems tackled
**approximately** by EAs, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to mathematically quantitize
these (typically *implicit*) assumptions behind different EAs, and also their working principles
(e.g., **from first principles**). In this open book, we will first discuss the hard-to-clarify
relationships between underlying assumptions and black-box applications. Note that in practice,
the level of black-boxes vary on different classes of complex problems.

Up to now, there have been several *wonderful* books devoted to EC, such as [[Eiben&Smith, 2015]](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-44874-8), [[De Jong, 2006]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/6267245), [[Fogel, 2006]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/5237910)/[[Fogel, 1998]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/5263042), [[Mitchell, 1998]](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4675/An-Introduction-to-Genetic-Algorithms), [[Back, 1996]](https://academic.oup.com/book/40791), [[Koza, 1990]](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/90/1314/CS-TR-90-1314.pdf), to name a few. Furthermore, there have been a number of *well-written* review/survey/perspective papers for EC or one particular class of EAs: e.g., [[Miikkulainen&Forrest, 2021, Nature MI]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00278-8), [[Lehman et al., 2020, ALJ]](https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article/26/2/274/93255/The-Surprising-Creativity-of-Digital-Evolution-A), [[Eiben&Smith, 2015, Nature]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14544), [[Schoenauer, 2015]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9014-7_28), [[De Jong&Fogel&Schwefel, 1997]](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781482268713-13/history-evolutionary-computation), [[Koza, 1994]](), [[Forrest, 1993, Science]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.8346439), just to name a few. Undoubtedly, all of these above works provide multiple *good* starting points to learn EAs or one particular algorithm class for practice and to enter the EC research community.

With the renaissance of [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608014002135) (now also called [deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539)) for AI/ML, the interesting interactions between **learning and evolution** (e.g., [[Hinton&Nowlan, 1987]](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/baldwin.pdf), [[Maynard Smith, 1987, Nature]](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/maynardsmith.pdf)) are worthwhile to be further investigated.

Finally, we thank very much for Prof. Shi and Prof. Yao which have provided our
Ph.D. opportunities to study AI/ML and in particular EC. We also acknowledge
all the authors () and reviewers () from each relatively independent chapters.
