As shown by Frances H. Arnold, Prof. of California Institute of Technology, in her Nobel Lecture,
"[Responsible for adaptation, optimization, and innovation in the living world, evolution executes
a simple algorithm of diversifcation and natural selection, an algorithm that works at all levels
of complexity from single protein molecules to whole ecosystems.

An important yet difficult research question to be answered is the (underlying) assumptions behind [Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14544). Since the black-box (or more generally, complex) nature of most hard (e.g., NP-hard) problems tackled by EAs, it is very difficult (if not impossible) to mathematically quantitize these (typically *implicit*) assumptions behind different EAs, followed closely by their working principles. In this book we first discuss and analyze the hard-to-clarify relationships between underlying assumptions and black-box applications. Although initially (at the beginning stage) their biological evolution-based inspirations (in a form of metaphors) are an attractive/interesting point to readers, researchers, and practitioners, undoubtedly their **mathematical foundations (theoretical insights), algorithmic frameworks (implementation softwares), and practical usefulness (real-world successes)**, which are of our great interest in this book, play three cornerstone roles in the increasing maturity of the well-known [Evolutionary Computation/Computing (EC)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-44874-8) field.

Our modest goal for this open book is to provide basic information regarding to EC and some (unfortunately *not all*) advanced topics, in order to help the novices foster the ability of judging whether or not it is a [good](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11721-021-00202-9) research practice for EC, which we think is very crucial especially for novices in the [explosion of of metaphor-centred methods](https://publications.aston.ac.uk/id/eprint/44574/1/ALIFE_LLCS.pdf) and the rise of [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://chat.openai.com/). Our main focus on EC is (and should be) **general principles** of designing and analyzing EAs (that is, *when, why, and how to use EC*) and their **real-world applications**, rather than only their [biological metaphors](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/blob/main/Summary/EvolutionaryComputation.md#metaheuristics) (though some metaphors played an interesting/important role in their early formation stage). Although we still believe there may be little [opportunities](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00278-8) to significantly extend the basic EC framework (such as [Quality-Diversity](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14422)), most of EC's *fundamental* algorithmic structures have been fixed/unchanged over the past 20 years, to some extents. For effectiveness and efficiency, ["leveraging (or learning) the statistical and computational structure of problem"](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/MAL-070) no matter *explicitly* or *implicitly* is now one of main research goals when desiging different EA versions/variants/improvements for different kinds of hard problems (such as [EDA](), [CMA-ES](), [NES](), [Surrogate Models](), just to name a few).

Up to now, there have been several *wonderful* books devoted to EC, such as [[Eiben&Smith, 2015]](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-44874-8), [[De Jong, 2006]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/6267245), [[Fogel, 2006]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/5237910)/[[Fogel, 1998]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/5263042), [[Mitchell, 1998]](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4675/An-Introduction-to-Genetic-Algorithms), [[Back, 1996]](https://academic.oup.com/book/40791), [[Koza, 1990]](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/90/1314/CS-TR-90-1314.pdf), to name a few. Furthermore, there have been a number of *well-written* review/survey/perspective papers for EC or one particular class of EAs: e.g., [[Miikkulainen&Forrest, 2021, Nature MI]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00278-8), [[Lehman et al., 2020, ALJ]](https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article/26/2/274/93255/The-Surprising-Creativity-of-Digital-Evolution-A), [[Eiben&Smith, 2015, Nature]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14544), [[Schoenauer, 2015]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9014-7_28), [[De Jong&Fogel&Schwefel, 1997]](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781482268713-13/history-evolutionary-computation), [[Koza, 1994]](), [[Forrest, 1993, Science]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.8346439), just to name a few. Undoubtedly, all of these above works provide multiple *good* starting points to learn EAs or one particular algorithm class for practice and to enter the EC research community.

With the renaissance of [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608014002135) (now also called [deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539)) for AI/ML, the interesting interactions between **learning and evolution** (e.g., [[Hinton&Nowlan, 1987]](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/baldwin.pdf), [[Maynard Smith, 1987, Nature]](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/maynardsmith.pdf)) are worthwhile to be further investigated.

Finally, we thank very much for Prof. Shi and Prof. Yao which provide our Ph.D. opportunities to study AI/ML and in particular EC. We also acknowledge all authors (Yuwei Huang) and reviewers (Guochen Zhou) from each (relatively independent) chapters.
