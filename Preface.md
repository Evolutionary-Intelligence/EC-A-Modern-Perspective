# Preface

An important yet difficult research question to answer is the (underlying) **assumptions** behind Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), followed closely by their **working principles**. Since the **black-box** nature of the problems tackled by EAs, it is often very difficult to **mathematically quantitize** these (typically *implicit*) assumptions. Although initially their **biological evolution-based inspiration** is an attractive point to readers, researchers, and practitioners (at the beginning stage), undoubtedly its **mathematical foundations and practical usefulness** play a cornerstone role in the (increasing) maturity of this field (i.e., Evolutionary Computation).

Our **modest** goal for this book is to provide basic information regarding to EC, in order to help the novices foster the ability of judging **whether it is a good research practice or not for EC**, which we think is very important especially for some novices.

Up to now, there have been several wonderful books devoted to EC, such as [[Eiben&Smith, 2015]](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-44874-8), [[De Jong, 2006]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/6267245), [[Fogel, 2006]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/5237910)/[[Fogel, 1998]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/5263042), [[Back, 1996]](https://academic.oup.com/book/40791), to name a few. Furthermore, there have been some well-written review/survey papers for EC: e.g., [[Lehman et al., 2020, ALJ]](https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article/26/2/274/93255/The-Surprising-Creativity-of-Digital-Evolution-A), [[Eiben&Smith, 2015, Nature]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14544), still to name a few. Undoubtedly, these works provide a *very good* starting point to learn EAs and enter the EC community.
