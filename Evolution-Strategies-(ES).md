# Evolution Strategies (ES)

**Evolution Strategies (ES)** were originally proposed by two students [Rechenberg](https://web.archive.org/web/20180425010001/http://www.bionik.tu-berlin.de/institut/xstart.htm) and [Schwefel](https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/people/schwefel/) at the Technical University of Berlin ([TUB](https://www.tu.berlin/en/)), Germany in the 1960s. For a detailed introduction to the history of ES, we strongly suggest to refer to [[Hansen et al., 2015]](), especially from two early pioneers. In this book, we mainly focus on **modern** ES versions and variants: **CMA-ES**, **NES**, **OpenAI-ES**, **Persistent ES**, and **Meta-ES/Distributed ES**.
